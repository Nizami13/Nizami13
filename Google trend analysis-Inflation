**Google Trend Analysis-Inflation**

Around 3.5 billion searches are performed on Google daily, which means that approximately 40,000 searches are performed every second on Google. So Google search is a great use case for analyzing data based on search queries. With that in mind, in this article, I will walk you through the task of Google search analysis with Python.

Google doesn’t give much access to the data about daily search queries, but another application of google known as Google Trends can be used for the task of Google search analysis. Google Trends provides an API that can be used to analyze the daily searches on Google. This API is known as pytrends, you can easily install it in your systems by using the pip command; pip install pytrends.

I hope you now have easily installed the pytrends library in your systems, now let’s get started with the task of Google search analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries:
"""

pip install pytrends

"""Inflation has been very hot topic in the world in 2022. Here I will be analyzing the Google search trends on the queries based on “Inflation”, so let’s create a DataFrame of the top 10 countries which search for “Inflation” on Google:"""

import pandas as pd
from pytrends.request import TrendReq
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
trends = TrendReq()

trends.build_payload(kw_list=["Inflation"])
data = trends.interest_by_region()
data = data.sort_values(by="Inflation", ascending=False)
data = data.head(10)
print(data)

"""So, according to the above results, the search queries based on “Inflation” are mostly done in Zimbabve. We can also visualize this data using a bar chart:"""

data.reset_index().plot(x="geoName", y="Inflation", 
                        figsize=(20,15), kind="bar")
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.show()



"""We can also see the growing interest in Goolge search for inflation, using the below graph:"""

data = TrendReq(hl='en-US', tz=360)
data.build_payload(kw_list=['Inflation'])
data = data.interest_over_time()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20, 15))
data['Inflation'].plot()
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.title('Total Google Searches for Inflation', fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Total Count')
plt.show()

"""**Conclusion**

So we can see that searches based on “inflation” on Google started to increase in the second half of 2021 and the highest searches were done in 1st quarter of 2022. This is how we can analyze Google searches based on any keyword. A business can perform Google search analysis to understand what people are looking for on Google at any given time. I hope you liked this article on Google search analysis with Python.
